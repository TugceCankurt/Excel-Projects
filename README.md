### <ins> Pet Box Subscription
**Code and details :** [.ipynp](https://github.com/TugceCankurt/Excel-Projects/blob/main/Pet%20Box%20Subscription.ipynb) <br>
**Description :** In this project, I explored what products should include the monthly pet box subscription. I cleaned the data and create charts to answer the following questions to help with the decision; How many products are being purchased more than once?, Do the products being purchased again have better sales than others?, What products are more likely to be purchased again for different types of pets?   <br>
**Method:** Data Cleaning, Pivot, Creating chart
